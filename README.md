## Contents:
disassembled: Some pseudocode and notes from my reverse engineering.
firmware-patched: Modified HEX files for real hardware to isolate audio channels, one for channel (including noise).
processing-music-player: A messy program that's probably confusing to use. Was also originally meant to have high-level graphics emulation, some elements of that are left over.
recordings: Output wave files from the above program for individual channels and combined song, both original quality and higher quality.
